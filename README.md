![diagram](assets/diagram.png)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Have installed on your pc:
  - Python >= 3.7
  - Docker and Docker Compose

And an ESP8266.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ekimdev/espws.git
  ```
2. Change the macros in firmware/config.h with the network data
3. Compile and upload the firmware to your ESP
4. Copy the .env.sample as .env and modify the environment variables to your needs
  ```
  $ cp .env.sample .env
  ```
5. Start docker services
  ```
  $ docker-compose up
  ```
6. Connect your ESP and the listener will start sending data! :)

### Usage
InfluxDB provides a user interface, you can login to: [localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086/). You can view and create your own dashboards or use the default

#### API
 Use:
  ```python
  import requests

  response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/")
  response.json()
  Out: {'temperature': 23.4, 'humidity': 49.0}

  # You can also bring the data separately
  response_temperature = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/temperature")
  response_temperature.json()
  Out: {'temperature': 23.4}
  ```

 Interactive API docs by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):

  Now go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/docs)

  You will see the automatic interactive API documentation
